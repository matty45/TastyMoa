# TastyMoa
An extension to the halo reach tag test build that comes with the halo mcc mod tools.

## Goals:
* Add, extend and expose some if not all engine functionality for people to play with.
* Online Multiplayer and potentially local split-screen multiplayer too.
* Toggle debug functionality to make the game run faster when needed.
* Bring back useful legacy functions or behaviour. (Flood ai logic, coloured PRT for example)
* Allow more programming languages to be compiled to blamscript bytecode?
* Add new abilities to blamscript.

# Coming Soon.
